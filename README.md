# Murach's Python for Data Analysis
This repository contains my solutions to the activities and exercises from the book Murach's Python for Data Analysis. The exercises focus on applying Python programming techniques to perform data analysis, visualization, and manipulation using libraries such as pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and more. This project is part of my journey to enhance my Python and data analysis skills.

Feel free to explore the code and track my progress!
